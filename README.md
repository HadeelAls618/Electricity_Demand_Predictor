# Batch Prediction Service for Hourly Electricity Demand in the US  

## Project Overview  
This project is a **batch prediction service** designed to forecast **hourly electricity demand** across the United States. The service utilizes **machine learning models** to analyze historical energy consumption patterns, weather conditions, and other relevant factors to generate accurate demand predictions. These predictions can be used for **grid optimization, load balancing, and energy trading strategies**.  

## Features  
- **Batch Processing:** Predicts electricity demand in hourly intervals for a given dataset.  
- **Machine Learning-Based Forecasting:** Utilizes trained models to generate demand predictions based on historical data.  
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed to handle large datasets and process predictions efficiently.  
- **Weather & Seasonal Adjustments:** Factors in external variables such as temperature, humidity, and seasonal trends.  
- **Automated Pipeline:** Supports scheduled batch predictions with minimal human intervention.
